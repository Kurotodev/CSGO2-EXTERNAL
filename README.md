# ⚠️ Educational Cheat / Reverse Engineering Project

> **This project exists strictly for educational, academic, and experimental purposes.**  
> **It is NOT intended for use in live environments, public servers, or production games.**

---

## 📌 Description

This repository contains an **experimental project** focused on **technical analysis, reverse engineering, and understanding protection systems** commonly found in games and interactive applications.

The primary goal is to **learn how these systems work internally**, **identify detection vectors**, and **understand defensive techniques** — **not** to bypass them in real-world environments.

---

## 🎯 Educational Objectives

This project aims to:

- Understand **client architectures**
- Analyze **memory behavior, hooks**
- Study **Anti-cheat and detection mechanisms**
- Learn about:
  - Debugging
  - Reverse engineering
  - Computer security
  - Software architecture
- Encourage **defensive thinking** (how to secure systems)
